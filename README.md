## Introduction

Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at better speeds with classical computers. This repository focuses on key quantum algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Deutsch-Josza Algorithm
- Grover's Algorithm
- Shor's Algorithm
- Quantum Fourier Transform

## Getting Started

To get started with quantum algorithms, you should have a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and linear algebra. Familiarity with Python programming and Qiskit will be beneficial.

## Algorithms Included

Here are some of the algorithms available in this repository:

1. **Deutsch's Algorithm**: A quantum algorithm to determine whether a function is constant or balanced.
2. **Grover's Algorithm**: An algorithm for searching unsorted databases with quadratic speedup.
3. **Shor's Algorithm**: An algorithm for factoring large integers efficiently.
4. **Quantum Fourier Transform**: A quantum version of the discrete Fourier transform.

## Installation

To run the algorithms in this repository, you need to have Python (3.5+) and Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit
